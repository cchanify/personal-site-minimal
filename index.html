        <p>Security Engineer at Uber</p>
        <p>Prior to this I worked as a Cybersecurity Consultant at Stroz Friedberg. I graduated from Middlebury College in 2019 with a Computer Science degree and Political Philosophy minor. While at Middlebury I captained the <a href="http://sites.middlebury.edu/ultimate/2018/06/18/middlebury-guy-pranksters-2018-season-recap/" target="_blank">Men's Ultimate Frisbee Team</a>, participated in our computer science club, MiddleEndian, and tutored CS students.</p>
        
        <p>I'm interested in technology, especially in products that help people live better. I am particularly curious about security, web3, biotech, and renewable energy, although I'm always ready to learn new things. I'm a fan of the <a href="https://www.dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html" target="_"> Worse Is Better</a> UNIX philosophy and a lover of minimalism.</p>

        <p>I also like to <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/chanify" target="_blank">bike, swim, and run</a>.</p>
